# Stackdump Core

This crate contains definitions for memory regions and register data.

Also see the [main repo readme](../README.md).

The [Capture](https://crates.io/crates/stackdump-capture) crate can capture the runtime data and registers into these types.
To get traces from the captured memory, use the [Trace](https://crates.io/crates/stackdump-trace) crate.
